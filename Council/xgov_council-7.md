## Introduction

Hey everyone — I’m applying to join the xGov council to help strengthen decentralized governance and ensure that public goods funding supports real builders and projects making a positive impact.

Over the past year, I’ve helped build out several core projects on Voi Network, including Nautilus (NFT marketplace and staking hub), HumbleSwap (DEX), and the enVoi naming service. These experiences gave me a deep appreciation for the role of public goods and how important it is to get incentives right. I want to bring that same energy and scrutiny to the xGov process on Algorand — supporting proposals that are clear, constructive, and aligned with ecosystem goals.

## Relevant Experience

I'm a full-stack developer and product builder focused on open-source infrastructure and decentralized apps. I’ve been active in both technical development and community-facing initiatives — from building incentive programs and marketplaces to writing governance frameworks and whitepapers.

I’ve also worked on tokenomics design, staking contracts, smart contract libraries (like OpenSubmarine for Algorand AVM), and contributed to an ecosystem standard such as ARC-200.

This combination of technical and community work gives me a well-rounded perspective that I’d bring to reviewing proposals, flagging potential issues, and helping others refine ideas to get them over the line.

## Project Affiliations

- PactFi → CTO  
- HumbleSwap → CTO  
- Nautilus → Founder  
- enVoi Naming Service → Founder  
- BUIDL Token → Governance & Incentive Design  

## Additional Information

- I’ve been active in cross-chain and Algorand governance discussions, contributing proposals and feedback on topics ranging from retroactive funding to incentive alignment.  
- I currently serve as a Voi Council Member, helping shape governance initiatives and steward community growth.  
- I'm passionate about creating systems that reward builders, not just speculators — and I see xGov as a powerful tool to do exactly that.  

Let’s make this thing work.
