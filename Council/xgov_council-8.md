## Introduction

Hey Algofam!

I’m Mohamed Majdalawieh, known as Angel of Ares, and I’ve been active in the Algorand ecosystem since 2020. As a full-stack developer and founder of Angels of Ares on Algorand, I have deep knowledge of DeFi, NFTs, dApps, and community projects. With a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering and experience as a day trader, I’m ready to contribute to the Algorand Governance Council.

If elected, I’ll work hard to push the ecosystem forward, taking on my responsibilities and going beyond what’s expected. Thank you for considering my candidacy.

## Relevant Experience

Since 2020, I’ve been heavily involved in Algorand, managing hundreds of wallets and millions of transactions, all verifiable on-chain. I’ve used a wide range of dApps, including DeFi platforms, staking tools, NFT marketplaces, Discord games, and more.

As a full-stack developer, I’ve built several applications, including:

Websites:

- Fallen Order MMORPG: https://fallenorder.xyz

- Samurai: https://samurai.angelsofares.xyz

- Creator Tools: https://fallenorder.xyz/tools

Discord Bots:

- Six bots for Fallen Order to manage gameplay

- Funman: A free service for Algorand projects to boost community engagement

- Voiman: Built as a free service for projects on Voi, however we decided to not pursue a path into Voi due to its extremely centralized nature compared to Algorand

- Ninjaman: Tracks Rug Ninja platform activity on-chain and reports to Discord in real-time

- Swapman: Monitors Algorand blocks and reports DEX swaps to Discord in real-time

## Projects Affiliation

- Angels of Ares: Personal brand on Algorand

## Additional Information

There are many great candidates out there for a council position, and I wholeheartedly believe I match that criteria to serve Algorand well and provide support where needed.

I bring a wide variety of knowledge to the table, have various connections across the ecosystem, utilize the chain heavily, build on Algorand, and intend to continue learning and growing with the network.

I appreciate this opportunity and thank you for giving this proposal a glance!
