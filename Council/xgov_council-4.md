## Introduction

Hi everyone, I’m applying for the position on the council to help xGov evolve into a functional and beneficial tool for funding public goods in the Algorand ecosystem.
I’ve been actively involved with xGov since its first iterations and have consistently been vocal about potential issues or attack vectors targeting it, which reflects my genuine motivation and goals for the program.
If elected i'll make sure there is no exploitation or malicious activity, as we’ve seen in the past, and i'll advocate for genuine proposals get a fair chance at funding.

## Relevant Experience

I'm a full-stack developer by trade, turned crypto founder in 2021, proudly wearing all the hats that come with the role.
I have extensive technical knowledge in VR, AR, Metaverse and Gaming fields and have a thorough understanding of all processes involved in ideation, bootstrapping, MVP, fund-raising and running a project.
I believe that my technical knowledge, combined with my experience as a Web3 project founder within the Algorand ecosystem, gives me a unique perspective with insights specific to this space that would greatly benefit the proposal evaluation process.

## Project Affiliations

Cosmic Champs -> co-founder

## Additional Information

In the past i've been actively promoting and helping onboard Algorand projects to get involved with xgov program and algorand in general. I've participated in twitter spaces, attended x-gov workshop at Decipher and have also on many occasions discussed it in-person with builders from ecosystem as-well as Algorand foundation employees.
Previous activity on Algorand forums (most of my posts are xGov-related; however, I’ve also been active in general governance-related topics)
