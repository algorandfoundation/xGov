## Introduction
I want to become part of something greater — to take an active role in the development of the Algorand ecosystem. I tell my friends and family about the potential of this blockchain and I want to be part of the change that is happening. I am ready to contribute and grow with the process.

## Relevant Experience
Since February 2023, I have been accumulating ALGO. Starting from Governance Period 8, I’ve actively participated in voting, including in xGov rounds. I consistently accumulate the token for long-term holding and believe in its enormous potential.

## Project Affiliations
Active participant in xGov governance and Algorand community. Long-term holder and ecosystem supporter.

## Additional Information
I confirm that I am ready to undergo KYC with the Algorand Foundation if selected. I have no conflicts of interest to declare.
