## Introduction

I discovered Algorand in 2020 and quickly fell in love—with the technology, the community, and the user experience. I’ve explored many other chains and ecosystems, but nothing compares. I believe deeply in Algorand and want the best for both the network and its users.

I’m excited to be considered for xGov and contribute meaningfully to its future. Please feel free to reach out on X if you have any questions.

## Relevant Experience

I currently serve as a **Director of Technical Program Management** at one of the world’s largest SaaS providers. Previously, I’ve worked as an Engineering Manager, Cloud Architect, Database Administrator, and Developer, with more than 20 years of experience across the tech stack. While I’m no longer hands-on in the code, my strategic and cross-functional expertise continues to deepen.

In my current role, I lead programs that span an organization of over 80,000 employees. I regularly bring together diverse stakeholders, align on priorities, and build consensus to move complex initiatives forward. This work has sharpened my ability to listen well, communicate clearly, and guide teams toward shared outcomes.

In 2023, I joined my first nonprofit board, gaining valuable experience in governance, mission alignment, and collaboration. This role has given me a strong foundation for thoughtful, mission-driven leadership that balances community input with long-term vision.

## Projects Affiliation

- 🛠 **Creator**: Arbitraz
- 🔁 **Node Runner**: BAJO
- 🧩 **Creator**: Algorand Scavenger Hunt

## Additional Information

Since 2020, I’ve been an active member of the Algorand community across X, Discord, and Reddit—helping users, answering questions, and contributing to ecosystem discussions. I also organized several community scavenger hunts to encourage learning and engagement in a fun, accessible way.

On the technical side, I’ve run Algorand nodes and built a number of small tools to interact with the chain. These include a bot that announces blocks won by the BAJO node, a volume generating bot for Arbitraz, and other lightweight utilities for personal and community use.

My involvement has always been driven by a genuine passion for the technology and the people building around it. I see xGov as a natural extension of that work and an opportunity to contribute in a more official capacity.
