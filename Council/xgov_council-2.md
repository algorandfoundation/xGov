## Introduction

I am a long-time Algorand community member and supporter, IRL and online. I am applying for xGov so I can bring my experiences from past and present DAO operations to make Algorand the best it can be! My primary focus will be on fiscal responsibility with community funds. I won't be auditing contracts or critiquing technical approaches, I defer to those who are experts. I will work with the community to get the best value for their funds. I will advocate and promote long-term sustainable practices.
