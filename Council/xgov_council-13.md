## Introduction
I have been an advocate for Algorand and its community awareness since March 2021. I believe in the future of Algorand to change the world as an infrastructure and as an ecosystem of builders/users, and the xGov program has the potential to realize this goal so long as it is managed with the proper care to mitigate conflicts of interest and fund those honest individuals with high-impact ideas that also have the tools to develop them into functional products. I have been a user of blockchain technology since 2015, and I have witnessed the rise and fall of many platforms and applications on blockchain since then. Algorand’s mission to bring decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain technology to the masses is pure, and my motivation for joining the xGov council is that I will be able to provide an additional voice of integrity, healthy skepticism, and cautious optimism for the council.

I have a PhD from Stanford University, and I now work in cancer drug-discovery research. My background in academia has exposed me the art of writing and critically evaluating grant proposals for funding as well as the legalities, strategies, and politics behind working with cutting-edge intellectual property. As a result of my technical training, I have strong logical reasoning and interpersonal skills (e.g., working in teams, giving feedback, resolving conflicts, corresponding virtually). I believe I would be a valuable member of the xGov council, and if the members of the voting panel agree, I would be grateful to be a part of Algorand’s initiative to responsibily allocate funding provided by the xGov program towards projects with clear and honest intentions, sound value propositions, and well articulated plans/timelines.

## Relevant Experience
Although I do not develop blockchain applications, I am very tech savvy and plugged into the Web3 world. I have followed the growth of Web3 closely and participated in many blockchain ecosystems - predominantly Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, Elrond, Solana, Cardano, and Algorand. Throughout my time in this space, I have been exposed to a wide variety of applications (Web3 and Web2) that people have made to address real-world use cases with blockchain (e.g., trading, stablecoins, decentralized identity, voting, real estate, artificial intelligence, intellectual property, and privacy), and I think my exposure to these diverse applications from the “top-down user end” gives me a unique perspective.

Regarding my involvement with Algorand specifically, I have followed almost every project that has launched on Algorand since the beginning of its ecosystem. For example, I participated in the original Yieldly no-loss lotteries, the launch of ORA, and I own some of the first NFTs that were launched on the chain. I have participated in most of the on-chain governance periods, and I am top 100 in blocks proposed with my own privately-hosted consensus node (consistently participating for over a year now). When time has permitted, I have made posts on Reddit to spread awareness of its technology and occasionally respond to FUD in the comments sections for whatever that is worth in the grand scheme of community narratives.

## Project Affiliations
I have no professional affiliations or conflicts of interest with any projects on Algorand.

## Additional Information
I have published multiple peer-reviewed scientific publications and filed patent applications.
