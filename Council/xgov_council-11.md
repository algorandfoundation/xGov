## Introduction

I’ve joined the Algorand community in 2019. As a governor, I’d focus 
on projects that bring the most value to the ecosystem.

## Social Profiles

https://algorand.hu - A resource for local builders

## Relevant Experience

- PoC with smart signatures, using PyTeal (2020)
- 3rd prize winner at Hackaton France for an RWA project, using TealScript (2024)
- Thesis helper for DML-Chain, an AI/ML data mart using Algorand blockchain (2025)
- Electrical engineer with coding expertise (C, PHP, SQL, PyTeal, TealScript), able to technically evaluate proposals.

## Project Affiliations

- No formal ties, but I’m active Forum user, see: https://forum.algorand.org/u/maugli/activity

## Additional Information

My grant evaluation priorities will be:
- Substance: clear technology, working prototypes, realistic milestones.
- Impact: projects that increase the utility of Algorand
- Soundness: Filter out projects heavy on hype, light on content
