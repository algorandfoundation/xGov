## Abstract
This proposal aims to bring production ready stateful smart contracts & tooling that act as an abstraction layer for interacting with the Algorand blockchain. This will allow businesses to offer their users a seamless onboarding experience & focus on delivering value to their customers, while amending some of the current UX friction points for new users. Through the use of plugins, users will be able to safely delegate authorizations opening up a whole new world of possibilities for the Algorand ecosystem.

## Team
Krby (https://twitter.com/kylebeeeee) has been a full time software engineer for over 7 years and has been spending his evenings building Akita for the better part of the last 2 years following the original dev teams departure. He's built a number of massive features for the Akita community including a staking platform, discord payment & verification bot (integrated with NFD's), Yoink Ball (an in person king of the hill game utilizing Freeze & Clawback) and a permissionless Community spec (ARC-53).

## Experience with Algorand
For nearly the last 2 years Krby has been spending his evenings building on Algorand. From writing smart contracts to building the base components of a longer term vision; a social platform built ontop of Algorand, NFDs, subscriptions & the community page spec. To date he's delivered an astounding amount of value to the Algorand / Akita community and has been the driving force behind the growth of the Akita platform:

- The most flexible staking platform on Algorand
- A discord bot that enables payments, verification, and more
- Yoink Ball, an in person game of king of the hill utilizing Freeze & Clawback
- Author of ARC53, a permissionless community spec that enables NFT and project exploration with some of the best UX on Algorand
- A shuffle system for Akita Omnigems where the NFTs have no data attached to them before sale
- Co-Author of ARC58, the Abstracted Account spec.

## Present Proposal
This proposal aims to acquire funding to build out the first production ready plugin based contract wallet for users on algorand. This abstraction will allow businesses on Algorand to offer their users a seamless onboarding experience & focus on delivering value to their customers. A Contract based wallet creates a massive set of new utility & convenience for users on Algorand. Over time tooling around this new wallet paradigm will be built out to enable users to safely delegate authorizations to plugins, opening up a whole new world of possibilities for the Algorand ecosystem.

## Future Blueprint


### Milestone 2: SDKs
Time Taken: 3 months

Amount: 50000

Description:
Javascript & Go SDK's for creating, managing & interacting with contract based wallets & plugins. Integration with our ecosystems standard use-wallet library for clean integration across dapps.

### Milestone 3: Plugins, Plugins, Plugins
Time Taken: 3 months

Amount: 50000

Description:
A standard set of plugin contracts for a myriad of uses within the ecosystem. The possibilities are nearly endless. We can have subscription plugins that allow users to pay automatically, NFT plugins for listing NFTs without them leaving your wallet. Bounty plugins for creating bounties that can be claimed by anyone, etc. The list goes on and on. The goal is to create a standard set of plugins that can be used by any business on Algorand to offer their users a seamless onboarding experience & focus on delivering value to their customers.


### Milestone 4: Flavored Contract templates & Documentation
Time Taken: 3 months

Amount: 50000

Description:
Variations of the abstracted account with differing native feature sets. ie: a contract based wallet with a 10 day delay on interacting with new addresses as a whitelisting safety net, etc.
Documentation for the SDKs, plugins & contract templates.


## Benefits for the community
Removing friction from user onboarding can help our network flourish by making onboarding less of a stumbling block for new & uninformed users. The learning curve of interacting with a blockchain is too steep for a large percentage of the population. This proposal aims to remove those barriers and offer businesses on Algorand a way to ease their users into web3 and bring the user of experience up to par with the rest of the web.
