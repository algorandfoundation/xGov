## Abstract
A dashboard that monitors the Algorand Inc structured selling that updates daily. 

## Team
https://twitter.com/sotpapasot

Blockchain data analyst working with Algorand data for more than a year. 

## Experience with Algorand
Building data analytics for Algorand DeFi and NFT protocols. I can aggregate data for any asset, application or account on Algorand

## Present Proposal
The Algorand Foundation version is available here. 

https://geniidata.com/user/papasotiriou/algorand-foundation-market-operations

It includes an interactive table with all the transactions from the two foundation accounts, a bar chart showing monthly expenses and an area chart showing the cumulative spending.
The requested amount is for covering my time to develop the queries and visualizations. 

My goal is to duplicate that dashboard. 

Based on my research, I have discovered the Algorand account that is related to the Algorand Inc. 
Please bear in mind that my findings may not be 100% accurate, since there is no transparency report to verify them. 

The reason why I am requesting more Algo than my initial xgov proposal is the lower $ price of Algo. 

I will be available for feedback from the community in order to improve or add more charts to the dashboard. 

## Benefits for the community
- Faster than extracting transactions as csv files from a blockchain explorer. 
- Onchain evidence that the Algorand Inc is selling Algo. 
- Almost real time data.

## Additional information
Open to work on other dashboards that are related to the Foundation's activities, such as Algorand Ventures, ecosystem growth funds etc.
