## Abstract
Ever imagined Al Goanna, COOP or MNGO as a game character in Cosmic Champs game PVP battle arena? So did we! There is plenty of Algorand projects that are great fit for our game setting. Unfortunatelly it's cost prohibitive for us to do such fun collabs as making a fully animated, game ready 3d NFT takes lots of resources. 
If funded, we will create and distribute these NFTs for free to help promote Algorand projects to our players and our game to the Algorand community. win-win

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
With help of community we will select two Algorand NFT projects whose theme is a good fit for our Game (and whose owners are OK with us doing it) and could be represented as a character in our game. Some examples of that woudl be Al Goanna, MNGO, COOP etc. For each project we'll create one signature NFT character (multimint) that will be fully functional in our game.
We will provide these NFTs for free to their projects and they can use them how they see fit. For an example to reward their communtiy or to run a competition. To get better idea here is our PEPE themed NFT that is playable in our game: https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1108380528 

## Future Blueprint
In future we would like to create more of these NFTs to help cross promote Algorand Projects to our players and our game to Algorand ecosystem.

## Benefits for the community
These NFTs will have multiple benefits. They will promote other Algorand projects to players of our game. We will provide these NFTs (at no cost) for other projects to use within their community in any way they like. This will also help push narrative that NFTs can be so much more than just 2d pictures.
