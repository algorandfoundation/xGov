## Abstract
Japanese people still have significant influence on the price aspects of cryptocurrencies, and not only with BTC. In various cryptocurrencies such as ADA, SOL, MATIC, ASTR, XDC, ENJ, XEM, JASMY, IOST, Japanese involvement alone has the power to maintain a certain price level, regardless of actual demand.

However, in the case of Algorand, there are very few Japanese users. Even with a generous estimate, the number of users holding ALGO is around 500, and on-chain activity accounts for less than 10%. This overall figure has hardly changed for about three years, despite the presence of a Japanese Algorand Ambassador and community champ. Honestly, he has little achievement in terms of recruitment, and since there is no expectation of significant influx from him, there is a need for community-driven efforts.

The main reasons for the lack of Japanese users are largely attributed to the characteristics of the Japanese population:

Almost 100% of ordinary Japanese individuals cannot handle languages other than Japanese.
Attempting to obtain ALGO for on-chain activities in Japan through normal means incurs a minimum fixed fee of 3000å†† (approximately $20) and approximately a 5% fluctuation fee.
Japanese people tend to follow celebrities and some are willing to move significant amounts based on celebrity statements. However, there are no influential celebrities among Algorand users in Japan.
To address this situation, the following approaches will be implemented to enhance the understanding of existing users and attract new users:

Provide high-quality information in Japanese that cryptocurrency users seek.
Give a few ALGO to individuals who do not currently possess ALGO, have them create their own wallets, and offer incentives to those who achieve certain results. However, this will be limited to users who can be confirmed as real individuals through some form of verification.
Form partnerships with influential influencers or organizations.

## Team
aper may not be able to engage in highly technical tasks such as building an app, but he can explain things in a clear and straightforward manner. 
He is capable of executing all on-chain activities as a user and can provide explanations from new users to advanced users. 
Additionally, he is capable of creating web pages.
Of course, he possesses a deep understanding of the Algorand ecosystem as well.


## Experience with Algorand
aper is a moderator on the official Algorand Japan Discord, and has been managing and providing information on their own since the Discord opened on February 27, 2022, for approximately two years.
Although operational expenses were paid twice in the past at 1,000 ALGOs every three months, aper is currently volunteering for the operations and has no intention of receiving compensation in the future.
The received 2,000 ALGOs have been utilized for three events to benefit Japanese users.

## Present Proposal
I plan to launch a website focused on providing information tailored to Japanese cryptocurrency beginners while highlighting the advantages of Algorand. Server and domain expenses will be paid in Japanese yen, but I will accept an equivalent amount in ALGO tokens. (I will not sell the received ALGO; it will be converted from my personal funds.) Additionally, leveraging my existing influential content outside of Algorand, I aim to attract traffic to the site organically.

I will initiate on-chain campaigns targeting existing Algorand users in Japan, with considerations for separate campaigns in the areas of DeFi, NFTs, and nodes.

I will introduce Algorand to age groups with significant outreach, focusing on student organizations. The current user base of Algorand Japan is predominantly in their 40s and above, with relatively weak influence on social media. Therefore, efforts will be made to reinforce their presence in this demographic.

Create an Algorand wallet for an influential organization and conduct a campaign targeting its followers.

## Future Blueprint
Since this is a one-time grant proposal, there are currently no plans to expand further on this. The management of Discord will continue even without the grant.

## Benefits for the community
I aim to increase awareness among Japanese and directly raise the price of ALGO.
