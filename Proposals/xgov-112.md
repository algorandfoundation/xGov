## Abstract
We're back! In this proposal we want to add in NFD Vault Support to reduce the opt-friction for new Algorand Users, Add ARC-36 Support (Non-Rarity Filters) to our Simple Mint and Update Tools, Add in advanced asset tools to change the Manager, Freeze, and Clawback Address, and add in a tool where you can enter a Wallet Address to download the tx history. In addition we plan on updating the site with a redesign. 

## Team
The team at Thurstober Digital Studios (xGov Periods 1 and 2 Awardees):

LoafPickle - Project Manager. I have 10 years of Project Management experience working in NYC on large scale construction projects. In addition, I am a long timer in the Algorand NFT Space and have been helping develop utility projects on the chain since May 2021. I am currently the Head of Strategy and Community for Thurstober Digital Studios. 

ByKewel - Tool Developer. Kewel is another Algorand NFT long timer that was the first to create wallet holding, sales, and listing discord bots that projects were able to incorporate into the ecosysytem. They also built the first on-chain DAO tool back in February 2022. 

Jenna (thurstober) - Project Lead.

Andrew (stablehand) - Lead Developer

## Experience with Algorand
All of us have been in the Algorand NFT Space since May 2021. Thurstober Digital Studios has built a full horse racing utility series and our body of work with The Laboratory (Formerly Evil Tools) speaks for itself.

## Present Proposal
NFD Vault and Segment Support - This one is similar to our simple send tool (https://labs.thurstober.com/simple-send). Here users can enter in individual NFDS or enter in a root NFD to pull all the segments and the assets will be airdropped into the vaults.

ARC36 Support for Simple Mint/Update - With ARC36 being finalized, we have already incorporated it into our bulk tools. We wanted to reformat our Simple Mint/Update tools so creators can easily add filters to their NFTs. 

Advanced Asset Tool - An easy way to change the manager, clawback, or freeze address for a selected asset.

Tx History Tool - An easy way to enter a wallet address and the tx history will be downloaded in a CSV format. This will be useful for things like taxes or Airdrops.

Site Redesign - Clean up the site to match the new theming on Wallet Enhancer.

## Future Blueprint
Build it. 

## Benefits for the community
The benefits are already being realized. When the myalgo hack went down, we quickly created mass add and send tools with Pera integration so creators and collectors alike were able to efficiently move their assets to safe homes. Since then, we have creators thanking us for providing them the tools we wish we had back in the early days of Algorand NFTs.

## Additional information
We had been approved in the first and second xGov Round to build more tools. The tools have since been completed and made open source.

In addition to the tooling, we also provide creator guides that allow new creators to get a lay of the ecosystem to help the onboarding experience. You can find them here: https://medium.com/@loafpickle
