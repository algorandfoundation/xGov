## Abstract
Remix-like web IDE to write, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts on Algorand using TealScript.

## Team
Shivaprasad - Developer
- 10 years of experience in building web applications.
- Core expertise in TypeScript.

## Experience with Algorand
Involved in the development of AlgoDesk, DappFlow, and PixelNode, contributing to the Algorand ecosystem over the past 2 years.

## Present Proposal

Develop web-based IDE for TealScript, similar to Remix for solidity.

But why? 
1. No setup needed. All you need is Chrome.
2. Workflow is simple, just write the contract in TealCraft IDE which supports complete TealScript IntelliSense, Compile, Deploy, and Test.
3. share your contracts with anyone with a simple button click.
4. New developer's onboarding becomes easy with an easy-to-use interface.

Competitor blockchains already have this kind of IDE.
Examples: 
    1. Flow blockchain (https://play.flow.com)
    2. Ethereum (https://remix.ethereum.org/)
    3. Solana (https://beta.solpg.io/)
    4. Aptos (https://playground.pontem.network/)

Don't you think we need a similar IDE for Algorand ? Especially TealScript is going to attract the TypeScript developers.


Here is the list of features:





## Benefits for the community

    1. Onboarding new developers is as simple as just sharing a simple workspace URL containing the contract. instead of asking them to set up everything.
    2. The ability to share contracts and workspaces with a simple URL makes it easy to collaborate.
    3. Are you trying to invoke someone else's contract ? TealCraft makes it easy to understand the application structure like methods(), states etc...
