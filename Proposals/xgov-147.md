## Abstract
Remix-like web IDE to write, compile, test, and deploy smart contracts on Algorand using TealScript.

## Team
Shivaprasad - Developer
- 10 years of experience in building web applications.
- Core expertise in TypeScript.

## Experience with Algorand
Involved in the development of AlgoDesk, DappFlow, and PixelNode, contributing to the Algorand ecosystem over the past 2 years.

## Present Proposal

TealCraft IDE is a pioneering web-based development environment tailored for TealScript on the Algorand blockchain, akin to Remix for Solidity. 
With a focus on accessibility, efficiency, and collaboration, TealCraft IDE eliminates the need for extensive setup, requiring only a web browser such as Chrome.

Why TealCraft IDE?

No installations, no complications. TealCraft IDE ensures a hassle-free experience - just open Chrome, and you're ready to write, compile, deploy, and test your TealScript contracts.

**Intuitive and Collaborative Development:**
TealCraft IDE boasts a user-friendly interface supporting complete TealScript IntelliSense. The workflow is streamlined, enabling developers to effortlessly create, manage, and share workspaces with a single click.

**Instant Sharing:**
Share your TealScript contracts effortlessly. TealCraft IDE simplifies collaboration by allowing developers to share contracts and workspaces through straightforward URL sharing.

**Onboarding Simplicity:**

**Compilation and Error Handling:**

Compile TealScript contracts and provide clear error messages on compilation failure.

**Output Console:**

    1. ABI - Display ABI with easy-to-understand UI. List of methods, expand each method, and view the details.
    2. App spec- View & download the App spec
    3. Programs - View & download approval, clear programs.
    4. Schema - View Global & state schema
    5. TSClient - Generate TS client and download.
    6. Download the source map file

**Shareable URLs:**

Generate shareable URLs for easy contract and workspace sharing.

**Browser Storage:**

The initial version stores workspaces and contracts in the browser itself, providing flexibility for developers.

**Export and Import:**

Effortlessly export and import workspaces/contracts between browsers.



## Benefits for the community

    1. Onboarding new developers is as simple as just sharing a simple workspace URL containing the contract. instead of asking them to set up everything.
    2. The ability to share contracts and workspaces with a simple URL makes it easy to collaborate.
    3. Are you trying to invoke someone else's contract? TealCraft makes it easy to understand the application structure like methods(), states etc...
