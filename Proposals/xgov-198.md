## Abstract

This is a retroactive proposal for impact delivered via CompX auto-compounding farms. These farms went live in 2023, and have been giving Algorand users a new way to earn higher yields from pools that they trust.

## Team

Kieran Nelson  - CEO/Founder at CompXLabs
Akingbesote Jesulonimi (Nimi) - Founder / Lead smart contract developer

## Experience with Algorand

Kieran - 2.5 years working in the Algorand ecosystem across Algogator and CompX. Extensive experience with Algorand SDK and ecosystem APIs.
Nimi - 2 years experience working with xBacked create smart contracts, front end and backend for the platform.

## Present Proposal

Auto-compounding farms take advantage of the composability of Algorand smart contracts and allow CompX to add a layer on top of Pact.fi farm contracts. This extra layer allows us to offer users the ability to claim, swap and restake their rewards on a frequent basis. This results in higher yields for the user.

### Deliverable

Auto-Compounding farms were delivered and went live on 20th November 2023 and currently hold over $1mm of TVL.

### Technical specifications

See forum comments for video outlineing auto-compounding farms.

## Future Blueprint

CompX auto-compounding farms will continue to be a core feature of CompX. We will be bringing V2 farms, which are fully independant of Pact.fi but V1 farms as they are now will still be utilised.

## Benefits for the community

1. The community can use our auto-compounding farms to gain higher yields while leveraging the proven contracts at Pact.fi.
