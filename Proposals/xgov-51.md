## Abstract
We are an Argentina-based community focused on onboarding new individuals into the blockchain and Web3 ecosystem through education, meetups, events, workshops, hackathons, and more. 
Our main objective is to innovate and attract new creative minds by expanding our rapidly growing community not only within Buenos Aires but throughout Argentina. 
We are committed to creating a positive local impact, as we firmly believe that Web3 is a solution to many issues affecting all of us in Latin America.

## Experience with Algorand
Details about the team's experience with the Algorand protocol and any previous projects built on it.
-GoPlausible: In all the events that we have hosted, as well as those planned for the future, we always give out Plaus to our community as keepsakes for them to remember and cherish the experience.
-Workshop “Conociendo y construyendo en Algorand from Zero to Hero” (Learning and Building on Algorand from Zero to Hero): We took part in the workshop and learned about Algo Kit and Beaker Development.
-Hackathon Mega Ace: We are proud that three teams from our community not only participated in the hackathon but also won national and international prizes (Hack Sabbath, Crypto Manijas, PowerPeople)
-Pera Wallet: In all our events, we recommend the use of Pera Wallet due to its numerous benefits, including speed, decentralization, safety, and a great interface for NFTs and Plaus. We love onboarding users through this wallet as it allows them to easily start interacting with the blockchain ecosystem.
- Our team participated in several Algorand events, providing help and volunteering hand-in-hand with the Algorand Foundation team members from Colombia and Peru (Camilo Molano and Evert Díaz).
