## Abstract
A tool for generating Algorand vanity addresses using GPU acceleration.

## Team
- Marcin Zawiejski (dragmz) - experienced professional developer

## Experience with Algorand
- Author of VSCode Extension for TEAL and WalletConnect v1 and v2 libraries for Go
- Build-A-Bull hackathon top 5 finalist in the gaming track (see CnC: Claim & Conquer)
- go-algorand contributor

## Present Proposal
- The tool will be provided as a command line utility for systems that can run Python 3.11+ and have OpenCL 3.0 capable NVIDIA GPU
- It can lookup for multiple prefixes at the same run, making the process more efficient compared to a single prefix search
- The prefixes to look for can be specified as a command line argument or a text file
- Licence: MIT or similar (commercial use allowed)
- Includes best-effort maintenance for at least 3 months from the date of the first release
- Delivery date: up to 3 months since signing the xGov funding contract

## Benefits for the community
Allows the community to quickly and securely generate recognizable Algorand addresses for their projects or personal use.

## Additional information
An example run of the tool:
```bash
pyagg --prefix AAAA,BBBB --count 10 --benchmark
```
Output:
```
Looking for 10 keys with prefixes: AAAA, BBBB
