## Abstract
This proposal seeks to fund a new Agreement Signing & Voting tool that enables any user, brand, or community to deploy custom contracts for streamlined proposal creation, encrypted agreement signing, decentralized voting, and immutable record keeping.

By providing these essential collaboration and decision-making features within a highly intuitive user-experience, we aim to attract and onboard teams and businesses, primarily from outside the Algorand ecosystem.

## Team
Jesco Brandt (@heartberg)
* Full Stack Engineer with 3 years of professional experience
* GitHub: https://github.com/heartberg

Mark Crae (@dolphinkitty)
* Product Manager / Designer with 10+ years of experience

## Experience with Algorand
Jesco has been actively developing Algorand based projects for >3 years. In this time he has created ~20 PyTeal smart contracts and multiple Front / Back ends to support this. The smart contracts cover a wide range of application types, including staking, vesting, trading, and more.

Together, Mark and Jesco have been building the <a href="http://everyone.space">Everyone.space</a> platform for the past year. When launched, Everyone will provide important web3 utilities for the Algorand ecosystem.

## Present Proposal
The proposed tool will enable anyone to easily create and deploy custom contracts aligned to their specific needs, whether that is:
* Encrypted agreement signing
* Voting and collective decision-making
* Immutable record keeping
  * client conversations, change logs, documents, etc
* Instant polling for community engagement
* Research and feedback acquisition

The tool’s highly intuitive no-code UX will provide a streamlined experience across a range of signing, voting, and record keeping workflows, and solve key problems that many teams and brands face while collaborating and transacting. Blockchain is the obvious solution to these issues, however most business people do not currently realize this. By building an easy to use tool that solves these problems in a way that no web2 solution can, and then communicating the value proposition, we can help bring many new users to Algorand.

For user acquisition, we plan to target teams and brands outside of the Algorand ecosystem and even outside of crypto. However, users will be required to have an Algorand wallet to interact with voting contracts. We will provide the necessary information and tutorials to streamline wallet creation and user onboarding.

The Agreement Signing & Voting tool will be integrated within the upcoming Everyone platform, joining a suite of user-friendly no-code utilities for the Algorand network. By combining signing, voting, and immutable records with other community and creator commerce utilities, we aim to create a hub for projects to organize all their web3 and business activities.

By taking advantage of the key user-experience benefits of the Algorand protocol such as speed to finality and low cost, we can create a best in class tool that attracts users and promotes trust, engagement, and inclusivity across the ecosystem.

Key Features:
* Signing and voting contract configuration and deployment
  * A core feature within the system are no-code forms for configuring and deploying dedicated agreement signing and voting smart contracts per team or project
* Multiple voting models to support diverse governance use cases
  * Simple Majority Voting
  * Supermajority Voting
  * Token-weighted voting
* Public and private voting and signing
  * Support for sensitive decision-making, encrypted signing and IP protection
* Access controls and user permissions
  * Specify requirements for proposal creation, voting, and agreement signing
* Enhanced transparency and trust
  * Immutable record keeping and verification
* Dedicated webpage for project-specific voting experiences
  * Projects can create a dedicated mini websites associated with their voting contract, providing comprehensive project information to users
  * Real-time voting activity and results
 
## Future Blueprint
We are here to support and update this project over the long term, far beyond the scope of this proposal.

## Benefits for the community
Key benefits:
* Build a product that is so useful and user-friendly that it helps drive the expansion of the Algorand user base.
* We specifically plan to target non-Algorand teams and businesses
* Provide an improved voting & agreement signing experience for Algorand ecosystem projects.
* Promote a fairer, more engaged, and inclusive ecosystem.
* We pledge to open-source the code in the event of any future project sunsetting

## Additional information
The voting smart contract will be open-sourced to ensure transparency and trust. Additionally, of course the crucial parts of these systems will be audited by third parties. We will also document any necessary steps for creating a privacy layer.
