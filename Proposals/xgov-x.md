## Abstract
This is an unofficial honeypot. If you can read and understand this, DO NOT vote for this proposal. Your votes will be wasted. If this proposal passes, the funds will not be claimed. You do not have to vote for all proposals to remain eligible for the xGov program (see the notice on the [official voting page](https://xgov.algorand.foundation/)). If you vote for this proposal, you will be hurting the xGov program and the Algorand ecosystem.

## Team
Concerned xGov - a member of the Algorand community disappointed with the progress of Algorand governance programs, hoping to contribute by challenging the system.

## Experience with Algorand
Concerned xGov is a long-time Algorand user, node runner, Governor, and xGov.

## Present Proposal
The funds will not be claimed. Any votes to this proposal will be wasted.

## Future Blueprint
Challenging the system further to push its development.

## Benefits for the community
The proposal will provide insight into the behavior of xGovs and hopefully steer the program in the right direction based on the voting results.

## Additional information
The proposer urges the readers to thoroughly assess all the proposals they are voting for. There might be misleading, malicious, or spam proposals that do not benefit the Algorand ecosystem.
