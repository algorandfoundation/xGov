## Abstract
Build a 3rd person fighting game on Algorands blockchain using Algorands SDK for Unreal engine. The fighting game would be similar to God of War 3 in terms of fighting style. Players would face off in a 1v1 style fighting game and winner would recieve in game currency (fractional NFT). It would be 
best 2/3 in terms of rounds with a 4 minute time limit per round. Players would be allowed to customize their own character however armor would have to be bought since it would be an NFT. One piece armor with different style armor for male and female. 
This would be a PC, Xbox and Playstation game and maybe mobile depending on its success. Its very similar to Mortal Kombat but with a God of War 3 style camera and abilities. 
## Team
Software Engineer. two blender modelers, 1 character modeler, 1 environmental artist and 1 gameplay designer/programmer and more depending on funding approval.

## Experience with Algorand
Details about the team's experience with the Algorand protocol and any previous projects built on it.
> eg
    > Using SDKs- I have used an SDK before (for Unreal Engine) but not an Algorand SDK.
    > Building applications- I know how to build on Unreal Engine but I have not built anything with an Algorand SDK or anything that implemented blockchain technology yet. 
    > Understanding of DApps- I have used them but have not developed any
    > Knowledge about the ecosystem-I have been an Algorand holder since Febuary 2021. I am aware of 60% of the dapps built on Algorand. 
    > Running nodes-zero knowledge 

## Present Proposal
The plan is to develop a 1v1 fighting game and launch it by Summer 2024. The initial launch would only possess of one gamemode, character customization, and NFT armor that can be purchased (and earned on some cases). Depennding on the success of the project,
the team would expand on the idea and eventually add a ranked mode and mobile support. Players log into the game using their wallet, create a character (if one has not been created), choose their fighting class, then que up for a duel. Winner receives in game currency 
and/or algo. Once the match is over, they sign a smart contract to receive their rewards and then are able to que again. There would only be 2 maps to start off with, small arena maps that fit the theme of the project. Players would also receive titles 
and flairs depending on their success (win rate) since there will be a leveling system. The leveling system would increase if they win and decrease if they lose. Players with high levels would receive in game rewards, rare titles, rare flairs, and potientially more 
in game items depending on the success of the project. 

## Future Blueprint
Expand on the project by adding more maps, ranked mode, and maybe an open world mode where players can show off their cool in game rewards.

## Benefits for the community
Allows the community to play an Unreal Engine game on Algorands blockchain and expand the gamefi ecosystem. Also community members can learn from this project to potientially build a better version of the project on Algorands blockchain. And it 
will be fun!! There are not any third person fighting games on Algorands blockchain.
