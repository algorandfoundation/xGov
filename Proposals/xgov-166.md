## Abstract
Simon Says is an experimental ASA trading project on Algorand with novel way to reposition and distribute liquidity across multiple platforms. It uses a very sophisticated method of human experience and gut feel to participate in the decentralised market. - everybody can see the composition of the wallet as it is public on the blockchain. Each ASA token in the wallet will be purchased exclusively via algorand DEXes such as Tinyman, humble and Pact.

## Team
Simon

## Experience with Algorand
- Active in Algorand space since 2021, has helped devlop multiple projects on Algorand, has an advisor role to some and has since its inception been very active in xGov program and feels it's his duty to propose this nonsense proposal to highlight the issues with the proccess. 

## Present Proposal
- With this grant request i request funds to buy select ASAs on Algorand blockchain, increase asa reserves and deposit it them to amm for liquidity, airdrop to engage algofam or simply hodl them to increase scarcity. I reserve full rights to use the funds however i see fit without any prior notice.

## Benefits for the community

- you can sleep better knowing Simon Says Liquidity proejct is doing exactly what it was created to do. Buying random ASAs establishing a diamond hand hodl narrative for the entire algofam.

## Additional information
- i might or might not forfeit the funds if the proposal passes
