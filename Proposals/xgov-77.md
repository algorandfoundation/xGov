## Experience with Algorand
I have been in the Algorand space since May 2020 and actively developing since June 2021. (joined all Governance periods :))

Developed a lot projects like <a href="https://algocodexnft.com">Codex</a> (NFT project), Discord bots (sale&listing, verification, game) and websites (eg. <a href="evil-tools.thurstober.com">Evil Tools</a>, <a href="https://mentalmarvin.art">Mental Marvin</a>) on Algorand. You can check my some projects <a href="https://github.com/algovado/Algorand-Community-Portfolio">here</a>.

Also I received a grant from <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/xGov/pull/8/files">previous xGov</a> and came second in the AlgoHouse NFTNYC2023 event with the Evil Tools project with Thurstober Studios.

## Present Proposal
I plan to update the AlgoVerify project and release an open source version.

Currently Available:

* Pera and Defly wallet support
* NFDomain support
* Dashboard for project owners
* Leaderboard for projects and holders
* Discord bot (898131542486954014) application commands

What I will do:

* New Features
  * */leaderboard* command on Discord.
  * Create API for developers. Community developers will be able to use the API in their projects with current data.

* Open Source:
  * Make the project open source.
  * Prepare a documentation for developers.
  * Prepare a documentation for self-hosting.

* Dockerizing:
  * Dockerize the backend and frontend parts of the project.

* Free Version:
  * I have <a href="https://ipfs.algonode.xyz/ipfs/QmefMpt6npv2bNhC4rxqNkS6Gtop4SgmmKK39pwroAkWqL">paid</a< the server and domain fees until June 2024, I will make the current version free for everyone. This way, community will continue to use AlgoVerify and API for free.

I plan to complete the project in a month. If the proposal is passed, I will start working on it immediately.

### Used Technologies

* Frontend: React, Tailwind
* Backend: Express.js
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Discord Bot: Discord.js
* Other: GitHub, Vercel, Oracle Cloud

## Benefits for the community
One of the biggest benefits of the Algorand ecosystem is the community. Make the AlgoVerify open source and enable self-hosting for everyone. This will allow anyone to use the Discord verification system for free. Also it will be a good example for developers who want to develop a Discord bot.
