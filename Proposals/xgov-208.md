## Present Proposal

DigiLeaf proposes to operate a (4) stall 250 Amp super charger station in Southern California

### Deliverable

4 stall ev charging station build on the algornad network. Please see Future Blueprint for milestones.

## Future Blueprint

The first milestone can be created within 3 months.

**Milestone 1:** 300,000 Algorand

Architectural and Engineering design plans for selected location for the (4) stall 250 Amp super charger station.

Land lease signed (doesnâ€™t cover rent) and plans are approved by the city.

**Milestone 2:** 800,000 Algorand

Acquisition of hardware.

Beginning of installation of transformer and hardware

## Benefits for the community

1- Consistent daily transaction volume via chargers. Each charger can fully charge about 15,000 vehicles a year.
2- New Algorand holders who would not normally use crypto currency. _ Support of actual use case scenario helping crypto currency as a whole.
3- Low carbon emissions on the roads.
4- Increase access to electrical vehicle chargers._ Increase decentralize the grid.

## Additional information

The land available for a long term lease depends on when we are awarded funds. We currently have a short list of locations in the San Diego County area and are ready to move on design plans immediately.
