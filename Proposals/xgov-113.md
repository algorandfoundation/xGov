## Abstract
Wallet Enhancer - Enhancement! In this proposal we want to add in Asset Details for when you click on an asset and it will show the asset details along with the metadata information. In addition, you can go on another wallet, select assets, and set up an atomic swap transfer. 

## Team
The team at Thurstober Digital Studios (xGov Periods 1 and 2 Awardees):

LoafPickle - Project Manager. I have 10 years of Project Management experience working in NYC on large scale construction projects. In addition, I am a long timer in the Algorand NFT Space and have been helping develop utility projects on the chain since May 2021. I am currently the Head of Strategy and Community for Thurstober Digital Studios. 

ByKewel - Tool Developer. Kewel is another Algorand NFT long timer that was the first to create wallet holding, sales, and listing discord bots that projects were able to incorporate into the ecosysytem. They also built the first on-chain DAO tool back in February 2022. 

Jenna (thurstober) - Project Lead.

Andrew (stablehand) - Lead Developer

## Experience with Algorand
All of us have been in the Algorand NFT Space since May 2021. Thurstober Digital Studios has built a full horse racing utility series and our body of work with The Laboratory (Formerly Evil Tools) speaks for itself.

## Present Proposal
Asset Details - Show the name of the asset, ASA ID, Unit Name, Creator Wallet, Standard(s), Clawback/Freeze, and all of the Asset metdata for ARC3, 16, 19, 36, and 69 NFTs.

Trades - The ability to easily create a swap of up to 16 assets so users can freely select and trade with each other. This will land on the Thurstober Claims page which is part of xGov 114. 

## Future Blueprint
Build it. 

## Benefits for the community
The benefits are already being realized. When the myalgo hack went down, we quickly created mass add and send tools with Pera integration so creators and collectors alike were able to efficiently move their assets to safe homes. Since then, we have creators thanking us for providing them the tools we wish we had back in the early days of Algorand NFTs.

## Additional information
We had been approved in the first and second xGov Round to build more tools. The tools have since been completed and made open source.

In addition to the tooling, we also provide creator guides that allow new creators to get a lay of the ecosystem to help the onboarding experience. You can find them here: https://medium.com/@loafpickle
