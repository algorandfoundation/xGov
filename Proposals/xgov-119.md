## Abstract
Zorkin plans to develop a <a href="https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/" target="_blank">ZK-SNARK</a> based solution for low-friction user authentication and transaction authorization with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login" target="_blank">Social Login</a> via supported OAuth providers (e.g. Google), linking the user's OAuth identity to a unique Algorand Account from which transactions can be authorized. Some Algorand specific user experience challenges, such as explicit asset Opt-In approval, will be addressed cohesively. A fiat on-ramp will be integrated into the solution for regulatory-compliant blockchain asset purchases using popular payment methods such as credit card. It will be launched as a paid service with pricing that is estimated, although not guaranteed, to be competitive with alternatives like <a href="https://web3auth.io/" target="_blank">Web3Auth</a>.

Disclaimers:
- The proposal is subject to terms, conditions and disclaimers as outlined in the body of the proposal
- Should the proposal be unfunded or fail to pass, we reserve the right to discontinue Zorkin development, terminate our plans and close any public services

## Team
- Winton Nathan-Roberts as Research, Design & Software Engineering lead
- Skilled independent contractors for auxiliary tasks spanning software engineering, legal consultation, and financial services

Contractor work will be rigorously checked for validity.

## Experience with Algorand

Winton Nathan-Roberts is a Machine Learning PhD dropout boasting over 4 years of industry experience in Software Engineering with various startups and blue-chip companies, including <a href="https://wargaming.com/en/" target="_blank">Wargaming</a>.

He has dedicated over two years to developing an Algorand-based Web3 gaming venture. Currently he is focusing on streamlining the onboarding process, with solutions that lower friction in Algorand account authentication, transaction authorization, and fiat purchases. Some of his projects can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/Helium-Labs/" target="_blank">Helium Labs</a> on GitHub, though many repositories are private.

Here are some relevant projects he has worked on, linked to videos for further detail:

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_M8aunqZyA" target="_blank">Aido - FIDO2 Transaction Authorization</a>: Implements the passwordless & phishing-resistant FIDO2 protocol for transaction authorization from an Algorand account
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66N7bFn19Ck" target="_blank">SessionWallet</a>: Provides low-friction application specific account creation and transaction approval, leveraging transactions as session tokens via on-chain MsgPack parsing

## Present Proposal

Zorkin plans to develop a drop-in solution for low-friction user authentication and transaction authorization with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login" target="_blank">Social Login</a> via supported OAuth providers (e.g. Google), linking the user's OAuth identity to a unique Algorand Account from which transactions can be authorized. At its core, users authenticate themselves using a familiar <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a> experience. The resulting JSON Web Token (JWT) access token can then be utilized to create an authorized session wherein users can approve transactions from their linked Algorand account with the associated session parameters. <a href="https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/" target="_blank">ZK-SNARKs</a> are used to preserve the privacy of the JWT access token during session authorization, so it isn't revealed on-chain. The sensitive session access keys are stored within the interfacing application client, intended for management by the user, making the solution self-custodial.

<a href="https://sui.io/zklogin" target="_blank">ZK-Login</a> by Mysten Labs, created exclusively for the Sui blockchain, has inspired the development of Zorkin. Zorkin plans to introduce various improvements such as allowing seamless OAuth client migration, postponing session creation until necessary, among other enhancements.

Zorkin aims to enhance the user experience on Algorand by tackling its inherent challenges, like the requirement for users to manually opt into assets. To that end, we may offer a compatible <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/pull/269" target="_blank">ARC-56</a> compliant plugin-based contract account. [xGov-117](./xgov-117.md) proposes to develop ARC-56.

Lastly, our plan includes adding a regulatory-compliant, third-party fiat on-ramp service like <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/en-au" target="_blank">MoonPay</a>. This will enable users to buy approved assets with popular payment methods, including credit cards.

### Prototype Video Demonstration

We are currently experimenting with several design variants. One notable variant can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Helium-Labs/Zorkin" target="_blank">Zorkin GitHub repository</a>. For a preview of this variant, watch the video below showcasing a prototype demonstration.

The final product may substantially change from the above preview after further development.

### Deliverables

The deliverables of this proposal are the success criteria, against which the proposal can be considered delivered on should they be met, and are enumerated below.

`ZorkinInfra` is defined as a <a href="https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/" target="_blank">ZK-SNARK</a> based <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/" target="_blank">OpenIDConnect</a> authentication solution that authenticates access to a Self-Custodial Algorand Account, that's local to a specific tenant. A tenant is an application interface to `ZorkinInfra`, through which users can authenticate access with `ZorkinInfra` to self-custodial Algorand accounts that are local to the tenant. `PaymentInfra` is defined as payment infrastructure that allows billing of tenants for their usage of `ZorkinInfra` to cover related operating expenses (e.g. cloud hosting costs) and a pre-determined profit margin. The `Dashboard` is an area where customers can configure their tenants, and manage their billing via `PaymentInfra`. `LegalConsult` refers to consulting with a relevant legal professional to ensure the deliverables comply with relevant laws, and to assist in drafting necessary legal documents such as terms of service.

In chronological order, the deliverables are:

0. Development of `ZorkinInfra`
1. Development of `Dashboard`
1. Development of `PaymentInfra`
2. Testnet Deployment of `ZorkinInfra`, with a tenant configurable via `Dashboard` and billed via `PaymentInfra`
3. Integration of at least one 3rd Party Fiat On-Ramp
4. Initiation and completion of `LegalConsult`  
4. Refinements of `ZorkinInfra`, `Dashboard` & `PaymentInfra` against feedback on their testnet deployments & legal consultation (`LegalConsult`)
5. Mainnet Deployment of `ZorkinInfra`, with a tenant configurable via `Dashboard` and billed via `PaymentInfra`

The delivery timeline is deliberately open-ended to prioritize legal compliance and consumer safety. The deliverables will be available for public access only in jurisdictions where they fully adhere to local laws. The deliverables will be adjusted against feedback from legal consultation to ensure legal feasibility. These services will be offered as long as they are financially viable and legally permissible, with a planned legal sunsetting and exit strategy to be devised and communicated to consumers through the terms of service.

Note the scope of the proposal, including the deliverables, are completely limited to whatever is described in this proposal document and excludes any external resource or dependency such as a Github repository where some design or intention may be proposed.

## Benefits for the community

If implemented, developers in supported countries could integrate Zorkin into their applications to facilitate Social Login for user authentication and transaction approval, creating a smoother experience. The inclusion of a third-party Fiat On-Ramp allows users to purchase approved assets using major payment methods, including credit cards. Some Algorand specific user experience challenges, such as explicit asset Opt-In approval, will be addressed cohesively. Furthermore, initial cost estimates for services like cloud hosting indicate that Zorkin could offer competitive pricing compared to alternative solutions like <a href="https://web3auth.io/" target="_blank">Web3Auth</a>.

## Additional information

### Open Source Clarification

The proposal's metadata suggests it will be Open Source, but this applies only to solution components chosen at our discretion such as certain frontend application clients. It is guaranteed that at least one component of the solution will be open-source. Each open-source component will be subject to a separate license with respective terms and conditions that must be adhered to. Any third-party code or design dependency will have its respective trademark, copyright & patent licenses respected.

### Ownership of Deliverables & Intellectual Property

The deliverables and any related novel intellectual property (IP) will be fully owned by Winton Nathan-Roberts, who reserves the right to do anything with the property as permitted by law. To the best of our knowledge, the IP isn't conflicting with any patents. The intellectual property and deliverables might undergo ownership transfers, leading to possible rebranding or integration with other companies or products. For instance, Zorkin could be renamed and associated with a different product the author is affiliated with undergoing similar ownership changes. Zorkin, described by the proposal, is a commercial endeavour with the aim to profit.

Zorkin will be a paid service, where users must pay for their usage covering operating expenses at minimum.

### Intellectual Property Clarity

The following is an argument as to why we think the Zorkin IP is safe to use and unlikely to encounter any disputes due to IP infringement. In particular, whether it is okay that Zorkin is similar in concept to ZK-Login by Mysten Labs, sharing some degree of design overlap. The following should not be construed as legal advice, is not written by a legal professional and is accurate to the best of our knowledge.

- Zorkin isn't a clone of any other solution. It is inspired by other solutions and makes several innovations
- Currently there are no known patents or pending-patents for similar ideas
- Several unpatented designs exist, like <a href="https://github.com/TheFrozenFire/snark-jwt-verify" target="_blank">Snark JWT Verify</a>. These designs are over a year old suggesting the idea of using ZK-SNARKs for OAuth/OIDC transaction authorization is unpatentable
- ZK-Login is described and implemented by Mysten Labs with most of its components existing in an open-source codebase with an <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">APLv2</a> license, and documentation that's covered by <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en" target="_blank">CC-BY-4.0</a>. Some components, in particular its circuit, are closed-source
- The conclusion we can reach is that the design for ZK-Login is most likely subject to APLv2, on the basis it is nearly described in its entirety in codebases that are subject to APLv2

Should any IP infringement dispute occur, or is predicted to occur, Zorkin will do anything it can to respect the law including preemptively terminating any public facing service with advanced notice per its Terms of Service. 

### Self-Custodial Definition

The proposal's Self-Custody aspect means that Zorkin or its affiliates do not hold users' sensitive account access keys, such as private keys, whose possession would allow the holder access to the users' account. Account access is restricted to the user, their OAuth account provider, and potentially frontend application clients.
