## Abstract
This project aims to transform vehicle rental/operation for members of society who have not previously been able to afford such a luxury.  This is not the tokenization of assets explicitly, but a rather similar idea functionally.  This is a methodicl business plan/implementation, not some attempted moonshot coin.  The tokens are essentially stocks in the company that people have the opportunity to buy in on the ground floor. 

## Team
Managing Partner: B.A. of Business Administration with a degree in Business Management.  I have plenty of skin in this project already.  Technical Advisor: Ph. D in Computer Science and is a managing partner at the Burcamp Advisory Group in San Antonio, Texas.  We will contract developers   

## Experience with Algorand
No programming experience as we are contracting a developer for the intial necessary smart contract.  I, the managing partner, have been closely following Algorand's progress for almost 3 years now.  

## Present Proposal
But our business plan focuses on members being able to reserve and use a vehicle for two separate 1½ hour blocks daily at a cost comparable to 60-70% of their average one-way rideshare cost. 
Our development team envisions raising the standard of living for millions across the globe through the crowd-sharing -to invent a word- of passenger vehicles.  The end-user will be able to use a NFT (non-fungible token) in their Pera/Defly wallets in combination with the existing NFC technology in their smartphones as the “keys” to a vehicle.  They just have to agree to have the vehicle back to the designated agreed upon location by the designated time -and clean, etc.- or their NFT will be turned off and costs will be associated should they wish to restore their priviledges.

## Future Blueprint
The project aims to raise funds through the fair presale of up to 65% of the total token supply with 30% reserved for community initiatives and staking rewards.  4,000,000,000 max supply ASA token has been created.  Phase 2 focuses on the technical challenges and costs associated with installing after-market RFID chips in the door handle.  Phase 3 will address the issue of creating/programming the vehicle's onboard computer to accept the key and backwards communicate regarding aspects of the vehicle's performance and location.  The vehicle will have to have internal wifi.  Phase 4 involves fleet acquisition and deployment in 1 major metropolitan area.  Phase 5 - Expand as the capital structure/health of the company allows.

The funds raised from this grant will be used to cover the advertising campaign needed to get traffic to our websites - Lifeshare Revolution.com and vidachida.com - for the token presale and incorporation costs.   

Excess capital that is raised from the presale that is not needed until Phase 3 will generate revenue by contributing to DeFi ecosystem liquidity pools.  As long as the Algorand Foundation can assure there are no rull-pulls in that environment, and no inscrupulous behavior on the part of Pera or Defly - our company is guaranteed to positively contribute to Algorand's ecosystem.  The smart contract will contain language that limits outflows from the account where the raised funds are sent that caps them at 10% throughout a rolling 365 day period beginning with the contract's deployment until day 730 at which time that limit will be increased to 10% of total market capitalization. This aspect assures investors that no rug-pulls can be carried out with respect to this project.    

The initial token price will begin at the price of $0.01 USD and a timed escalation mechanism -5 days- will increase by $0.001 each successive round and will not be offered in the U.S.A.  Radio ads to direct native Spanish speakers to the website will be effective - I'm fluent and vidachida means "cool life".  I can hardly believe I was able to procure that domain name at the undervalued rate -sound familiar Algonauts- even one I tried before that -vidamejor- was being sold for $9,000.  This one is better anyway, woohoo!  It's honestly the singular thing that makes me know the token sale will be successful. 

## Benefits for the community
This is a perfect use case for these burgeoning technologies and WEB3 dapps.  The project will contribute to the delationary mechanism inherent in the ALGO since plenty of minimum reserve balances will be created, it will be great publicity for the Algorand brand, and add significant robustness to the liquidity pools of the ALGO/ASA ecosystem.  At minimum, hundreds of thousands will have to opt-in to both Algo and STBL.  I think I'll even switch that halfway through the token sale to STBL2.


## Additional information
The timing for this project is perfect.  Divine inspiration at play here Algonauts!  A slashing mechanism will ultimately be in place to punish end-users who behave dishonestly.  Initial stakers will be allowed to unstake after 7 days have passed since completion of our ASA token distribution to the investors - which admittedly might contribute to some downward price action, but that potentiality can't possibly cause severe devaluation.  Final token distribution will be completed no later than 30 days after the expiration of the token presale.  The managing director will provide bi-weekly updates to the community through a designated social media account and our company's website.
