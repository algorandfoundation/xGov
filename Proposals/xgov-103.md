## Abstract
This project aims to transform vehicle rental/operation for members of society who have not previously been able to afford such a luxury. This is not the tokenization of assets explicitly, but a rather similar idea functionally. 

## Team
Managing Director: B.A. of Business Administration with a degree in Business Management.  Technical Advisor: Ph. D in Computer Science.  Developer: Unknown Currently - we are hoping the foundation can assist with publishing a solicitation for bids to obtain one.  

## Experience with Algorand
Details about the team's experience with the Algorand protocol and any previous projects built on it.
No programming - aside from the unnamed contracted developer to be named later.  I, the managing director, have been closely following the progress of this project for almost 3 years now.

## Present Proposal
The end-user will be able use a NFT (non-fungible token) in combination with the existing NFC technology in their smartphones as the “keys” to the vehicle. 
The members can reserve and use a vehicle for two separate 1½ hour blocks daily at a cost comparable to 70-80% of their average one-way rideshare cost. 
Our development team envisions raising the standard of living for millions across the globe beginning with the crowd-sharing of motorcycles and moto-taxis, then elevating the concept to passenger vehicles further down the roadmap. 

## Future Blueprint
The project aims to raise upwards of $5 million through the fair presale of up to 65% of the total token supply with 30% reserved for community initiatives and staking rewards.  4,000,000,000 max supply ASA token creation. 
The funds raised from this offering will be used to provide research and development operational expenses not to exceed 10% of the total raised during the first year.  
After the first year of operation, the development team can only spend a maximum of 20% annually and only from the revenues generated from operations. 
This aspect assures investors that no rug-pulls can be carried out with respect to this project.  
There are 30 planned rounds/stages of token presale, each lasting exactly 3 days.  
The initial token price will begin at the price of $0.001 USDC or USDT and increase by 5% each successive round - making the expected, initial listed price around $0.005 STBL or goUSDC. 

The entire balance of requested ALGOs are immediately payable back to the Foundation having provided them upon expiration of the token presale - with a break-even point of 25,000 investors worldwide (each pays 10 to get in).  

## Benefits for the community
This is a perfect trial use case for the burgeoning technology. WEB3 dapps. This project will increase daily transaction throughput, accelerate the deflationary mechanism inherent in the ALGO, and add significant robustness to the liquidity pools of the ALGO/ASA ecosystem.  The requested Algos are needed to cover legal costs of establishing the LLC, payment for a contracted developer to mint the tokens, pay for the project to be independently audited, to create the webpage/web3 interface for the token presale - maybe multiple are needed here, and for the intial marketing in case ASA is deemed unacceptable by the desired outlets.  

## Additional information
The timing for this project is perfect.  Divine inspiration at play here Algonauts!  A slashing mechanism will be in place to punish end-users who behave dishonestly.  Initial stakers will be allowed to unstake immediately upon total completion of ASA token distribution to the investors.  Final token distribution is estimated for completion no later than 30 days after the expiration of the token presale.  The managing director will provide monthly updates to the community via established social media platforms.
