## Abstract
This project aims to transform vehicle rental/operation for members of society who have not previously been able to afford such a luxury. This is not the tokenization of assets explicitly, but a rather similar idea functionally. 

## Team
Managing Director: B.A. of Business Administration with a degree in Business Management.  Technical Advisor: Ph. D in Computer Science.  Developer: Unknown Currently - we are hoping the foundation can assist with our efforts contracting one.  

## Experience with Algorand
Details about the team's experience with the Algorand protocol and any previous projects built on it.
No programming - aside from the unnamed contracted developer to be named later.  I, the managing director, have been closely following Algorand's progress for almost 3 years now.

## Present Proposal
The end-user will be able use a NFT (non-fungible token) in combination with the existing NFC technology in their smartphones as the “keys” to the vehicle. 
The members can reserve and use a vehicle for two separate 1½ hour blocks daily at a cost comparable to 60-70% of their average one-way rideshare cost. 
Our development team envisions raising the standard of living for millions across the globe beginning with the crowd-sharing of motorcycles and moto-taxis, then elevating the concept to passenger vehicles further down the roadmap. 

## Future Blueprint
The project aims to raise $5-$6 million through the fair presale of up to 65% of the total token supply with 30% reserved for community initiatives and staking rewards.  4,000,000,000 max supply ASA token has been created.   
The funds raised from this offering will be used to provide research and development and cover operational expenses.  Excess capital will generate revenue contributing to ecosystem DeFi liquidity pools until it is needed to advance the project.  
After the first year of operation, the development team can only spend a maximum of 20% annually and only from the revenues generated from operations.  Total annual operating costs are guaranteed to be <2% of the total capital raised for the first two project years.
This aspect assures investors that no rug-pulls can be carried out with respect to this project.  
There are 30 planned rounds/stages of token presale, each lasting exactly 3 days.  
The initial token price will begin at the price of $0.0025 USDC or USDT and increase by .00011 each successive round - making the expected, initial exchange-listed price around $0.004 STBL or goUSDC. 


## Benefits for the community
This is a perfect trial use case for the burgeoning technology and WEB3 dapps. This project will increase daily transaction throughput, accelerate the deflationary mechanism inherent in the ALGO, will be great publicity to the Algorand brand, and add significant robustness to the liquidity pools of the ALGO/ASA ecosystem.  The requested Algos are needed to cover initial legal costs, payment for the project to be independently audited, payment to create the webpage/web3 interface for the token presale, for the intial marketing to potential investors, and to provide token liquitity to the DeFi apps.  

## Additional information
The timing for this project is perfect.  Divine inspiration at play here Algonauts!  A slashing mechanism will be in place to punish end-users who behave dishonestly.  Initial stakers will be allowed to unstake immediately upon total completion of ASA token distribution to the investors.  Final token distribution will be completed no later than 30 days after the expiration of the token presale.  The managing director will provide monthly updates to the community via established social media platforms.  We also hope the Algorand Foundation will kickstart the token presale with an early investment when that time comes.  The timeline to market is 6 months after receiving the grant funds.
