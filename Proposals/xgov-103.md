## Abstract
This project aims to transform vehicle rental/operation for members of society who have not previously been able to afford such a luxury. This is not the tokenization of assets explicitly, but a rather similar idea functionally. 

## Team
Managing Partner: B.A. of Business Administration with a degree in Business Management.  Technical Advisor: Ph. D in Computer Science and is a managing partner at the Burcamp Advisory Group in San Antonio, Texas.  Developer: unknown currently - we won't hire a fulltime developer until the expiration of the token presale.  

## Experience with Algorand
No programming experience as we are planning to contract developers for the intial necessary smart contracts.  I, the managing partner, have been closely following Algorand's progress for almost 3 years now.  We have to be able to connect with qualified developers for this project to succeed.

## Present Proposal
The end-user will be able to use a NFT (non-fungible token) in combination with the existing NFC technology in their smartphones as the “keys” to a vehicle.  It is assumed that governments will authorize at least one form of digital payment -either stablecoin or CBDC- in the coming age, and we want the Algorand infrastructure to be ready when it does.  This functionality is currently thought to be necessary for our project regarding the purchasing of gasoline/refilling the vehicle in our proposed operating environment, AND furthermore could potentially supplant SWIFT's place in this arena regarding the acceptance of payment for all merchants.  

But our business plan focuses on members being able to reserve and use a vehicle for two separate 1½ hour blocks daily at a cost comparable to 60-70% of their average one-way rideshare cost. 
Our development team envisions raising the standard of living for millions across the globe beginning with the crowd-sharing -to invent a word- of motorcycles and moto-taxis, then elevating the concept to passenger vehicles further down the roadmap.  Technical and logistic constraints might force us to abandon the possiblity of using it for motorcycles and moto-taxis and shift focus to subcompact sedans. 

## Future Blueprint
The project aims to raise $5-$6 million through the fair presale of up to 65% of the total token supply with 30% reserved for community initiatives and staking rewards.  4,000,000,000 max supply ASA token has been created.  Phase 2 of the project focuses on developing interoperability between an Algorand NFT and the laser/optical scanner that's currently pervasive in settling merchant services payments.  Phase 3 will address the issue of creating/programming the vehicle's onboard computer to accept the key and backwards communicate regarding aspects of the vehicle's performance and usage.  Phase 4 involves fleet acquisition and deployment in 1 major metropolitan area, which is currently planned to occur somewhere in India.  Phase 5 - Expand as the capital structure/health of the company allows.   
The funds raised from this grant will be used to provide cover research and development and operational expenses -which are minimal- throughout Phase 1 and are primarily needed to cover the advertising campaign intended to get traffic to the token presale website. 

Excess capital that is raised from the presale that is not needed until Phase 3 -which will be around a year from now- will generate revenue by contributing to DeFi ecosystem liquidity pools.  As long as the Algorand Foundation can assure there are no rull-pulls in that environment, and no inscrupulous behavior on the part of Pera or Defly - our company is guaranteed to positively contribute to Algorand's ecosystem en perpetua by my calculations.  The company will have a positive cash flow/revenue stream by the end of the first year in operation, due to not having any full-time employees until Phase 3.  A smart contract is currently sought to be developed to cap the company's total annual spending at $600,000 USD -10% of raised capital- for the first two years of operation.
Beginning with year 3 of operation, the company leadership can only spend a maximum of 10% annually of the project's total diluted market capitalization.  Total annual operating costs are estimated to be <2% of the total capital raised throughout phase 2.
The combination of these aspects assures investors that no rug-pulls can be carried out with respect to this project.    
The initial token price will begin at the price of $0.01 USD for the first million raised.  Once that point is reached, the token sale will be closed to angel investors.  A timed escalation mechanism -4 days- will then be initiated, having the sell price of $0.015 -increasing $0.001 each successive round until the $6 million cap is attained.  This event will establish the date of the token presale's expiration and initiate the day counter for Phase 2. 


## Benefits for the community
This is a perfect trial use case for these burgeoning technologies and WEB3 dapps.  This project will increase daily transaction throughput, accelerate the deflationary mechanism inherent in the ALGO, will be great publicity for the Algorand brand, and add significant robustness to the liquidity pools of the ALGO/ASA ecosystem.  The requested Algos are needed to cover the cost of having our smart contract audited and chiefly to fund the advertising campaign to direct traffic to the presale website.  In fact, the Algorand Foundation can even maintain these Algos and use them to oversee that proccess.  Maybe assign a staffer since it can't be that complicated, and I'm sure you all know way more about that than I do.  And just maybe the $6M goal can be realized without using that entire amount especially given your existing ability to influence - should you choose to use it supporting this project.

## Additional information
The timing for this project is perfect.  Divine inspiration at play here Algonauts!  A slashing mechanism will ultimately be in place to punish end-users who behave dishonestly.  Initial stakers will be allowed to unstake after 7 days have passed since completion of our ASA token distribution to the investors - which admittedly might contribute to some downward price action, but that potentiality can't possibly cause severe devaluation.  Final token distribution will be completed no later than 30 days after the expiration of the token presale.  The managing director will provide bi-weekly updates to the community through a designated social media account and our company's website.
