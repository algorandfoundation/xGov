## Abstract
The extension adds a support for TEAL to Visual Studio Code.

## Team

## Experience with Algorand
- Author of a GPU-based vanity address generator for Algorand
- Build-A-Bull hackathon top 5 finalist in the gaming track

## Present Proposal
- The extension provides the following features:

  - code completion
  - signature help
  - hover info
  - go to definition
  - go to symbol
  - document outline
  - syntax highlighting
  - rename symbol
  - syntax validation features

- It comes with a Language Server Protocol server for TEAL that can be potentially used with other LSP-compatible editors.
- The extension will be publicly available from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Once installed, it's ready to use with no extra configuration.
- Licence: GPLv3
- Includes best-effort maintenance for at least 3 months from the date of the first release
- Delivery date: up to 3 months after receiving a confirmation that the xGov funding for the proposal has been secured

## Benefits for the community
The extension will make it easier for developers to write TEAL code by providing a set of features that are common in the modern editors.

## Additional information
The extension has been successfully used to write over 60KB TEAL smart contracts code for the Build-A-Bull hackathon.
