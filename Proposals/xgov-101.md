## Abstract
The extension adds a support for TEAL to Visual Studio Code. It provides code completion, signature help, hover info, go to definition, go to symbol, document outline, syntax highlighting, rename symbol and syntax validation features.

It comes with a built-in Language Server Protocol server for TEAL that can be potentially used with other LSP-compatible editors.

## Team
- Marcin Zawiejski - experienced professional developer

## Experience with Algorand
- Author of a GPU-based vanity address generator for Algorand
- Build-A-Bull hackathon top 5 finalist in the gaming track
- go-algorand contributor

## Present Proposal
The extension will be publicly available from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Once installed, it's ready to use with no extra configuration.

## Benefits for the community
The extension will make it easier for developers to write TEAL code by providing a set of features that are common in modern IDEs.

## Additional information
The extension has been successfully used to write over 60KB TEAL smart contracts code for the Build-A-Bull hackathon.
