## Abstract
Solluna mushroom farms is a farm-to-table business that is adopting Algorand's blockchain technology to educate and onboard mushroom growers and buyers.
We aim to achieve this by implementing the following key features to our business plan: (1) an ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) rewards only program for our customers and supporters, (2) an NFT based grow kit and farming course, and (3) an innovative environmentally green mushroom farm. We are requesting funding in order to execute these key features.

## Experience with Algorand

- Swapping asas
- Connecting to dapps
- NFT artist
- Running Nodes

## Present Proposal

#### SPORE Token
The farm will incorporate the SPORE token into the business model by giving holders discounts on our products. SPORE will be sent to clients that participate in our discord and Texas holdem poker tournaments.

#### NFTs
We plan on creating mushroom grow kits with NFTs associated to each type of kit. These NFTs will have information about the fungus, a spore print, and how to grow and take care of your new fungus.

#### Mushroom Courses
Our courses will assist new growers with retaining existing mushroom farm practices that can be easily transferred to their own farms. These courses will also include basic understanding of the Algorand ecosystem and technology, we will be doing this in order to prepare our clients for future collaborations.

#### Environmentally friendly farm
Our farms will be producing fungi by using repurposed recycled plastic with outdoor elements that will assist in healthy fungus. These farms will run off solar,wind, and hydropower at some locations. Solluna farms will be the first full scale fungi farm to use reusables!

## Future Blueprint
Online educational platform to teach crypto and fungi cultivation. Online marketplace full of wellness products, and mushroom cultivation supplies. Using the chain to track rewards for discounts using SPORE coin.

## Benefits for the community

#### Genuine Rewards Program
The SPORE token’s only purpose is as a rewards and discount token for our products. This token will not be available on decentralized exchanges or other decentralized finance applications. SPORE can be used with out products to get up to a 20% discount, the amount of SPORE needed to get the full 20% discount will be voted on by our community.

#### Educational
The on-boarding of new Algorand users will occur with each new student that completes our courses. Courses will explain how the Algorand blockchain works and how we integrate our farms with the technology.

#### Unique NFT use case
Each type of grow kit for a particular fungus will come with an NFT that provides detailed information on what the grower has purchased. This means for every grow kit sold, a grower will use the Algorand chain in order to read their instructions and get more information about the fungus.

## Additional information

#### Current clients in Oregon
- C Street Bistro - Italian cuisine
- Alchemy Restaurant and Bar - (fine dining) American style cuisine
We have one farm up and running! No debt, all self funded. 

#### Environmentally focused
Cultivating fungi is not very environmentally friendly. The majority of large farms use plastics for growth and never attempt to achieve the scale and sustainability of an eco-friendly farm. The creative reusing of bags and the use of solar and wind power by Solluna Farm will significantly alter the way that mushrooms are grown on a wide scale. The adoption of fungus will begin with educational courses. Since this will be the first application of NFTs in education, people will have a greater appreciation for what these devices are capable of. With practical classes offered around the state and online resources, we will instruct people on how to cultivate their own food and utilize technology responsibly in the Algorand Ecosystem.

Our two major goals will be to expand the Algorand blockchain and fungi. For ongoing research, the Oregon Solluna Farm will cultivate fungus with legal therapeutic properties. I currently work as a DSP for persons who have mental health issues; this product line will be put to the test in a variety of ways to demonstrate how fungi may actually benefit those in need. In the past I managed an Algorand NFT poker tournament. We had fifteen of the best NFT projects from Algorand on board. For our tournament we’ll be giving out courses, cross-chain games, mushroom rewards, and Algorand NFTs. Our hearts and souls, plus a little more, are going into this project since working with mushrooms, which has the potential to significantly improve mental health and other health issues.

This company offers in-person workshops, mushroom foraging expeditions, and a gentle introduction to cryptocurrency and mushroom cultivation.
