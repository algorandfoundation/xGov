## Abstract

The Algorand Rapid Open Source Software Assistance (AlgoROSSA) program will rapidly assist open source software development for Algorand.

## Team

SilentRhetoric is passionate about building the Algorand open source code ecosystem.

## Experience with Algorand

He has experience with Algorand dating to 2021, including creating ASA memecoins, making innumerable payment transactions with suggested params from objects, learning how to write the same auction demo smart contract in a growing list of languages, instigating ~~arguments~~debates in Discord with whomever is around, and having lots of opinions about how the Algorand Foundation ought to do things.

## Present Proposal

The funds awarded to AlgoROSSA will be used at SilentRhetoric's sole discretion to assist the development of free, open-source software (FOSS) that create 2+2=5 outcomes for Algorand.  This could include bounties and grants for code solutions, tooling, standards, examples, tutorials, and other contributions that lead to good outcomes for the Algorand community.

## Benefits for the community

Funding this proposal will enable xGov grant funding to be appropriated through an additional channel.  Currently, the xGov grant process runs quarterly and so it takes three months or more for any proposal to make it through the process and receive payment, and lots of people argue about it the entire time.  AlgoROSSA will be faster, less bureaucratic, and much less democratic because I'll decide the best time and way to direct the funds.

## Additional information

Vote for as many iterations of this proposal as you want to fund.
