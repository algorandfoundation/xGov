### Deliverable

## Future Blueprint

**This section is strictly informational. The grant request is retroactive and does not promise delivery of these changes**.

We plan to integrate the use-wallet V3 library soon.

## Benefits for the community

Wallets are important to the blockchain ecosystem. The AWallet was first open source algorand wallet from all active wallets on algorand. This helps developers with looking at the code on how to do payments, interact with blockchain and more.
