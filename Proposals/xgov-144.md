## Abstract
Last year we added MNGO & AL GOANNA characters to Cosmic Champs PVP battle arena and they were both a huge hit. There is many more Algorand projects that are a great fit for our PVP game. Unfortunatelly it's cost prohibitive for us to do such fun collabs as making a fully animated, AR ready,  game ready, 3d NFT takes lots of resources. If funded, we will create and distribute AlgoLeagues Algoman x CosmicChamps NFTs for free to help promote AlgoLeagues (one of the OG Algorand projects) to our players and our game to the their large user base that is also present outside of Algorand ecosystem. Such collabs work because they address different types of audiences and thus help spark interest to explore other parts of ecosystem or Algorand itself. To get better idea here is two of our recent collab NFTs that are playable in our game: <a href="https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1280977773" target="_blank">MNGO</a> ,<a href="https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1108380528" target="_blank">PEPE</a>

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
After our proposal was approved in last period we have seen great success with the two projects that were selected (Al Goanna and MNGO). There were a bigger collab campaigns created around each NFT that engaged both communities for an example we did a guest Dream quest with Mostly frens where participants were able to win the NFTs as reward. 
We would like to repeat this cross community collabs and bring some healty engagement between some of the OG Algorand communities. This time we wish to join forces with AlgoLeagues - an Algorand OG project that has built a loyal and active community that spans across multiple discord servers outside of Algorand itself and create a signature NFT character (multimint) that will be fully functional in our game.
We will provide these NFTs for free to AlgoLeagues community and will do an exciting campaign to ensure fair and fun dsitribution. To get better idea here is two of our recent collab NFTs that are playable in our game: <a href="https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1280977773" target="_blank">MNGO</a> ,<a href="https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1108380528" target="_blank">PEPE</a> 

## Future Blueprint
In future we would like to create more of these NFTs focusing on cross-chain/non-algo proejct collabs to bring new users into our game and introduce multitude of algorand OG projects to these new players. E.g. focus on bringin new people to algorand itself and showcase them a select subset of trusted OG Algorand proejcts to get them started.

## Benefits for the community
These NFTs have cascading effect. More of them we make and introduce to our game, the more cross community engagement and promotions cahn ahppen organically. They promote other Algorand projects to players of our game and tehy promote our game to wider NFT community. We provide these NFTs (at no cost) for other projects to use within their community in any way they like. Using our innovative AR ready, game ready, fully animated 3d models for NFTs will also help push narrative that NFTs can be so much more than just 2d pictures.
