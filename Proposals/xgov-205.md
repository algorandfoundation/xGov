## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2+ years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tCHmn3vTrU">Video presentation of the platform</a>
Cosmic champs is FREE to play, AAA-quality, Action-packed PVP strategy game that combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense and online battle arena! It is available on Android, iOS and Web since 2022. Game was frequenty featured in articles and publications and had presence in wider web3 ecosystem. It has consistently kept high social media score ever since launch - putting gaming on Algorand on the map. We are asking for a retroactive grant for our efforts in building and advertising gaming on Algorand which we firmly believe is yet to shine with Cosmic Champs leading the pack!

Blockchain Gaming will onboard the next big wave of users to Algorand. As one of the oldest and biggest games on algorand we are uniquely positioned to to carry lions share of that influx. To date, we are the only game that supports real time 3d PVP, with authoritative servers (more secure) on Algorand. This increased security and performance - which are both crucial as they implicity represent Algorand itself.

To date we have built and maintaned entire Cosmic champs platform (android + ios + browser game, 4 utility web pages and 2 seasons of innovative fully animated 3d game-ready AR compatibile NFTs). We can easily be considered benchmark in the space with active community and constant social engagement.

This type and scope of secure and performant infrastructure is expensive, and our current active userbase doesn't allow for profitability at this  stage so we are hopefull xgovs will recognize our contribution and value we bring to the ecosystem and will support our endeavours to ensure we remain on top of our game and fully prepared for the upcomming bull - we are commited to support the platform and keep updating and promoting the game and Algorand through 2024.

### Deliverable
We will build, maintain and promote Cosmic Champs and gaming scene on Algorand.
Deliverables(game) can be checked at: <a href="https://beta.cosmicchamps.com/" target="_blank">https://beta.cosmicchamps.com/</a> and via our social interactions or via video here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tCHmn3vTrU">Video presentation of the platform</a>.


## Future Blueprint
In the future, with increased userbase, we plan to become profitable as soon as possible to ensure the platform can keep meeting and exceeding the needs of algorand(and wider) gaming scene.

## Benefits for the community
Imagine a bad Algorand Wallet, if that wallet is slow and buggy(or hacked) people simply assume that is Algorands fault. To enforce the narrative that Algorand is great for gaming it is crucial that games are secure, performant and ideally built to appeal the masses - all of which Cosmic Champs is!

To date, we are the only game that supports real time 3d PVP, with authoritative servers (more secure) on Algorand. This increased security and performance are both crucial as they implicity represent Algorand itself (to an unedeucated user). Our game is using a proven model with very wide audience appeal and huge potential for mass adoption.

Cosmic Champs has been recognized with a nomination for the best blockchain game of 2023 by PlayToEarn. This nomination is a testament to the gameâ€™s impact and potential in the blockchain gaming community. Even more so as we were the only Algorand game that was nominated. 

We are constantly looking for new ways how to empower other Algorand projects (cross community NFT collabs, branded prize bots in our game) so they can benefit from our exposure and success and vice-versa.
