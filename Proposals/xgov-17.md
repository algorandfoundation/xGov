## Abstract
A dedicated permissionless secure high odds lottery webapp running on the Algorand blockchain!

## Team
Pax | Tinyleafgreens | Capt Mark 

## Experience with Algorand
We have previously built 2 web apps using the Algorand Blockchain, and have 2 years of experience building web apps using Algorand.

## Roadmap
V1 is complete and can be found at https://dotty.algoneer.net, the detailed road map/fees is here https://dotty.algoneer.net/docs, V2 will consist of quality of life changes, and mainly a fee structure change that will increase the fee amount to 1%(Max:1000 Algo) and the addition of a ASA Powerball style game with higher odds. The fee increase is solely to support our profit sharing model which uses all excess fees to buyback AGNR with the purchased AGNR sent to the LP rewards pool, this mechanism increases the value of AGNR and the daily LP reward amount.

## Benefits for the community
Another app using Algorand is always good, in terms of greatest value V2 Dotty is a stepping stone to V3 which will feature acceptance of any crypto/fiat via a simple exchange to DOT, this mechanism will directly benefit Algorand by attracting liquidity from the global crypto community, effectively making the V3 Lotto chain agnostic with Algorand acting as a settlement layer.
