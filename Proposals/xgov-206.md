## Abstract
<a href="https://agorapp.dev/" target="_self" rel="noreferrer"> AgorApp</a> is a cutting-edge educational platform, similar to Codecademy, but designed specifically for Web3 chains and protocols. Founded in 2022 and officially launched in the summer of 2023, AgorApp has established strategic partnerships with industry leaders such as Internet Computer Protocol, NEAR, Lisk L1, The Open Network, Solana, Ethereum Swarm, and Massa.

AgorApp has developed the most advanced chain-agnostic IDE in Web3 bringing in users from around the world to take our courses and challenges. Through AgorApp, Algorand will get new developers in both Web3 and Web2 from first-hand interactive coding lessons to spark interest for further growth.

The goal of the project is to integrate the Tealscript language into our IDE and develop a proof of concept course to be displayed in our education catalog. From there, we have the ability to expand on education and create competition challenges for future consideration.

## Experience with Algorand
Details about the team's experience with the Algorand protocol and any previous projects built on it.

AgorApp’s approach as a team is to enhance our knowledge of top chains in Web3. As hosts to the largest Web3 dev meetup in central Europe, we have done a session on Algorand within our meetup community.

## Present Proposal
A detailed plan for the development and implementation of the proposal.

1) **Integrate TealScript (or PyTeal) within IDE Environment**
   - Description: Integrating the Tealscript runtime with our infrastructure to run and evaluate user-submitted Algorand smart contracts. Extending IDE to support Tealscript.
   - Time duration: 1 month
   - Cost: 15,000 ALGO

2) **Build your first smart contract in Tealscript (or PyTeal) (proof-of-concept course)**
   - Description: Guiding users through the interactive development of their first Tealscript smart contract.
   - Time duration: 1 month
   - Cost: 15,000 ALGO
  
As mentioned above, we are available to adjust the focus of the course based on the community feedback - for instance, if the community values more an interactive coding course on PyTeal, then we are happy to ship it either as a replacement or as a complement to the TealScript course.

### Deliverable
Proposals must include clear, non-technical descriptions of deliverables.

**Deliverable: Opensource Tealscript Advanced IDE**
- The left side of the IDE showcases the description. On the right side, the user implements the solution. The IDE provides error feedback prompts and a hint button.
- Example courses available via our catalog page.

## Future Blueprint
A high-level plan defining overarching strategic objectives and major steps planned for achieving the project at a greater scale.

By integrating Algorand into our IDE, our next step is to expand education offerings with Algorand courses and challenges, such as "gas optimization" and "security". Additionally, launch an external contributor feature allowing Algorand dev members to monetize their courses and challenges on AgorApp.

## Benefits for the community
A description of the potential benefits that the proposal could bring to the Algorand community and its users.

Our goal at AgorApp is to onboard new developers into the Algorand ecosystem. With 300 active users and 2K monthly impressions, AgorApp has bootstrapped to a stage of growth. Adding Algorand into the mix will only accumulate more reach for developers to discover the benefits of Algorand compared to other chains.

## Additional information
Any other relevant details or documentation that the team would like to include in the proposal.

We are also volunteering with Ludo Scholtz helping organize the Algorand Prague Meetup on May 30th at Paralelní Polis.
