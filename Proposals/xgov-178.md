## Abstract

SIWA (Sign In With Algorand) is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to sign in to websites and applications using their Algorand wallet. SIWA is built on the Algorand blockchain and uses implements an Algo-equivalent EIP-4361 to verify user identity. SIWA is fully decentralized, fully compatable with EVM SIWE, secure, and transparent, providing users with a seamless and secure authentication experience. SIWA is open-source and free to use, making it accessible to developers and users worldwide.

- **EVM Compatibility**: SIWA will have tight compatibility with SIWE (Sign In With Ethereum), allowing developers to easily integrate SIWA into their existing Ethereum-based applications.
- **NextJS Support**: SIWA will support NextJS, a popular React framework, making it easy for developers to build fast and scalable web applications.
- **Enterprise Security**: SIWA will provide a best-practices security model and on-chain protocol for enterprise applications, ensuring that user data is secure and protected.

Feature 1: EVM Compatibility
SIWA will be modeled from the ground up to be compatible with SIWE, allowing developers to easily integrate SIWA into their existing Ethereum-based applications. This is a critical feature for developers who build Algorand applications with NextJS. This is a critical feature for developers who build EVM-compatible applications and want to leverage the Algorand blockchain for authentication.

Feature 2: EIP-4361 Equivalent
SIWA will implement an EIP-4361 equivalent on the Algorand blockchain. EI-4361 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that defines a standard for decentralized authentication on the Ethereum blockchain. SIWA will provide a similar standard for Algorand, allowing developers to easily integrate decentralized authentication into their applications.

Feature 3: NextJS Support
SIWA will support NextJS, a popular React framework, making it easy for developers to build fast and scalable web applications. NextJS is a powerful tool for building web applications, and SIWA will provide seamless integration with NextJS, allowing developers to build secure and scalable applications with ease.

Feature 4: Wallet/NFD Integration
SIWA will integrate with popular Algorand wallets, popular Algorand libraries, and NFD domains. This integration will allow users to easily sign in to websites and applications using their Algorand wallet, providing a seamless and secure authentication experience.
