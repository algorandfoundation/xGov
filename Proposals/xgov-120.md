## Abstract

The live version of (How to ALGO NFT)[https://www.howtoalgonft.com/] has been around for about a year. It has various categories related to onboarding and NFTs. Most of the categories contain links to external resources.

I am currently in the process of redesigning and rebuilding the website using Next.js/Payload CMS. You can view the progress at the link below.

https://staging.howtoalgonft.com

We'll be adding well-written articles for each of the 6 "Algorand NFT Essentials" to help users with all sorts of Algorand NFT-related topics.

## Team
My name is Zachary Minner. I've been a Web Developer for 10+ years. I've built over 100+ websites/apps through my day job as well as over 10 different websites for Algorand NFT collections.

I'll also be working with other Algorand community members to write articles for the website. This will be on a per-article basis.

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2+ years, I've been building an NFT community called Shitty Kitties with my wife. Shitty Kitties is more than just NFTs. We have many utilities through our website and our Discord channel that offer users a unique and Shitty experience.
- Wallet utilities like Mass Add and Mass Send
- Entertainment/Rewards utilities like casino, raffles, and vending machine
- Profile look-up 
- and more

I've also built over 10 websites/dApps for different Algorand collections as well as Discord bots, exactly to the collections/creator specifications. 

I build dApps using Next.js and JavaScript so therefore utilize the JavaScript AlgoSDK as well as AlgoNode APIs in my websites and Discord bots.

## Present Proposal

The idea is this. There are 6 categories of articles that will be on the website. Each category is geared towards informing the user about Algorand NFTs.

- Create your Algorand Wallet
- Fund your Wallet
- Buy New NFTs
- Create your own NFTs
- Sell Your Creations
- Manage Your Assets

For each category, the website will have multiple well-written articles to help the user learn about each. For example, "Buy New NFTs" will have articles explaining how to use each NFT Marketplace. "Create your Algorand Wallet" will have an article on how to create a Pera wallet and another on how to create a Defly wallet. 

I'd like to hire Algorand community members to write articles for the website. The proposal funds will go to finishing the website as well as funding writers to add more content to the site.

## Future Blueprint

We'll continue adding and updating content as we have with the live site. Things change and dApps add new features that we will write articles about.


## Benefits for the community

I think having a resource like this will be incredibly valuable to the community. How to ALGO NFT has been a great resource to the new Algorand community in its current state. The redesign as well as the increase in really well-written content will only help the site's ability to help new community members. 

## Additional information
I have a proven track record of getting shit done and done well. Building websites/apps and interacting with the Algorand community through Shitty Kitties are some of my greatest passions. I love the work I do here and hope to continue building cool shit for Algorand for year's to come.
